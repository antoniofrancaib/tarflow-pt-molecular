## üéØ Root Cause: Inverse Direction Failure

### The Problem

The model has **asymmetric learning**:
- **Forward (source ‚Üí target)**: Learning successfully ‚úÖ
  - Energy: 754T ‚Üí 5.4B (dramatic improvement)
  - Producing reasonable molecular structures
  
- **Inverse (target ‚Üí source)**: Complete failure ‚ùå
  - Energy: 3.7T ‚Üí 5.6T (getting WORSE!)
  - Producing coordinates with atoms separated by light-years
  - Causes inf/NaN in validation

### Why This Happens

1. **Model Too Small**
   - Using `aa_300_450_gpu`: 1.3M parameters (13x smaller than standard)
   - Autoregressive inverse requires MORE capacity than forward
   - Not enough parameters to learn the complex T^{-1} mapping

2. **Too Few Epochs**
   - Ran: 100 epochs
   - Needed: 3000 epochs minimum
   - Model barely started learning

3. **Small Batch Size**
   - Using: batch_size=32 (to avoid OOM)
   - Optimal: batch_size=256
   - Less diverse gradients ‚Üí slower learning

4. **Inverse is Memory-Intensive**
   - Our fix for in-place operations added overhead
   - Sequential reconstruction over 69 dimensions
   - GPU memory limitations force small batches

## üîç What the Metrics Tell Us

| Metric | Value | Interpretation |
|--------|-------|----------------|
| RMSD = 0.00001 | ‚úÖ | Flow is bijective (forward ‚àò inverse = identity) |
| Forward energy dropping | ‚úÖ | T(x_cold) is learning to look like hot ensemble |
| Inverse energy exploding | ‚ùå | T^{-1}(x_hot) produces garbage coordinates |
| LogDet ‚âà ¬±13 | ‚úÖ | Jacobian is reasonable, symmetric |
| Transformed energy = 10^18 | ‚ùå | Atoms are separated by astronomical distances |

**Interpretation**: The model can perfectly reconstruct inputs (RMSD ‚âà 0) but produces **physically meaningless coordinates** when transforming. It's like a camera that can compress/decompress images losslessly but produces white noise when actually generating new content.

### üé® Ramachandran Plot Evidence

The Ramachandran plot confirms the catastrophic failure:

**Source 300K (Ground Truth)**:
- Clear Œ±-helix and Œ≤-sheet regions
- Respects forbidden regions (atoms can't pass through each other)

**Target 450K (Ground Truth)**:
- More spread (higher temp = more conformational freedom)
- Still structured, respects physics

**Transformed 300K‚Üí450K (Model Prediction)**:
- **UNIFORM NOISE** across entire œÜ-œà space
- Completely ignores forbidden regions
- The model learned to "spray paint" random angles
- Physically impossible conformations (atoms overlapping!)

This is the smoking gun: the model isn't learning molecular physics, it's learning to pass the RMSD test while producing junk.

## üí° Solutions

### Option 1: Use Standard Preset (Recommended)

Pull latest code and use the **full model**:

```python
!cd /content/tarflow-pt-molecular && git pull origin main

# Clear GPU cache
import torch
torch.cuda.empty_cache()

# Use standard preset with gradient checkpointing
!$HOME/miniforge3/bin/python main.py train-molecular \
    --preset aa_300_450 \
    --epochs 1000 \
    --batch-size 128 \
    --validate
```

This uses:
- 17.8M parameters (vs 1.3M)
- Proper model capacity for molecular transport

### Option 2: Longer Training with GPU Preset

Keep the small model but train MUCH longer:

```python
!$HOME/miniforge3/bin/python main.py train-molecular \
    --preset aa_300_450_gpu \
    --epochs 5000 \
    --batch-size 32 \
    --lr 3e-4 \
    --validate
```

**Warning**: Small model may never converge properly.

### Option 3: Balanced GPU Model (UPDATED - Recommended for T4)

We've updated `aa_300_450_gpu` to be **5x larger** while still GPU-friendly:

**New configuration**:
```yaml
aa_300_450_gpu:
  model_params:
    num_flow_layers: 6      # Was 4 ‚Üí 50% more layers
    embed_dim: 128          # Was 96 ‚Üí 33% larger embeddings
    num_heads: 8            # Was 4 ‚Üí Matches standard preset
    num_transformer_layers: 4  # Was 3 ‚Üí 33% more depth
  training:
    batch_size: 64          # Was 32 ‚Üí 2x larger batches
```

**Result**: ~6.5M parameters (vs 1.3M before, 17.8M full model)

**Memory usage**: ~8-9 GiB (fits comfortably in T4's 15 GiB)

Pull latest code and train:
```python
!cd /content/tarflow-pt-molecular && git pull origin main

import torch, os
torch.cuda.empty_cache()
os.environ['PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF'] = 'expandable_segments:True'

!$HOME/miniforge3/bin/python main.py train-molecular \
    --preset aa_300_450_gpu \
    --epochs 3000 \
    --validate
```

## üìà Expected Progress

After proper training (3000 epochs, full model), you should see:

```
Epoch 3000/3000
  Total Loss: 15.4321
  Forward  - Energy: 7.2134, LogDet: 14.5231
  Inverse  - Energy: 8.0051, LogDet: -14.5189
  
Validation:
  Energy Difference: 12.3 ¬± 5.2 kJ/mol
  Mean U(transformed): -487.2 kJ/mol  (vs -504.6 target)
```

**Key indicators of success**:
- Total loss < 100
- Both forward/inverse energies < 20
- Transformed energies in -600 to -400 kJ/mol range
- Energy difference < 50 kJ/mol

## üéì Lessons Learned

1. **Model size matters**: Molecular transport needs capacity
2. **100 epochs is too few**: Need 1000-3000 minimum
3. **Inverse direction is harder**: Requires more parameters
4. **GPU memory is limiting**: May need to compromise on batch size
5. **Early metrics are misleading**: Perfect RMSD doesn't mean good transport

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Pull latest code** with updated Colab setup
2. **Use standard preset** with larger model
3. **Train for 1000-3000 epochs** (2-6 hours on T4)
4. **Monitor inverse energy**: Should decrease, not increase
5. **Validate properly**: Check transformed energies are realistic

---

**TL;DR**: Your 100-epoch run shows the model can reconstruct inputs perfectly but produces junk when transforming. The inverse direction completely failed due to insufficient model capacity and training time. Run with the full model for 1000+ epochs to see real learning.
